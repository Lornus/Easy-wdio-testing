# Reporter 
I choosed to use allure due to its simple configuration and informativeness 

# Videos and screenshots 
For every test-case there are screenshots and video that displayes in allure html report

# About failure test-cases
All tests are passed so you won't see failures, you asked to do failure screenshots, but in report now there are screenshots for all tests and in case of failure screenshot will be taken as well.
